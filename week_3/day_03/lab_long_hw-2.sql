-- Question 9.
-- 11. Return a table containing each employees first_name, last_name, full-time equivalent hours (fte_hours), 
-- salary, and a new column effective_yearly_salary which should contain fte_hours multiplied by salary. 
-- Return only rows where effective_yearly_salary is more than 30000.

-- and then alphabetically by first_name.

Question 16. [Tough]
Find the proportion of employees in each department who are grade 1.
Hints

Think of the desired proportion for a given department as the number of employees in that department who are grade 1,
divided by the total number of employees in that department.


SELECT
	department,
	count(id),
	count(cast(grade = 1 as INT)) AS grade_1,
	cast(count(cast(grade = 1 as INT)) AS REAL)/ cast(count (id)AS REAL) AS proportion
	FROM employees
	GROUP BY department;



2 Extension
Some of these problems may need you to do some online research on SQL statements we haven’t seen in the lessons up until now… Don’t worry, we’ll give you pointers, and it’s good practice looking up help and answers online, data analysts and programmers do this all the time! If you get stuck, it might also help to sketch out a rough version of the table you want on paper (the column headings and first few rows are usually enough).

Note that some of these questions may be best answered using CTEs or window functions: have a look at the optional lesson included in today’s notes!

Question 1. [Tough]
Get a list of the id, first_name, last_name, department, salary and fte_hours of employees in the largest department. Add two extra columns showing the ratio of each employee’s salary to that department’s average salary, and each employee’s fte_hours to that department’s average fte_hours.

[Extension - really tough! - how could you generalise your query to be able to handle the fact that two or more departments may be tied in their counts of employees. In that case, we probably don’t want to arbitrarily return details for employees in just one of these departments].
Hints


Question 2.
Have a look again at your table for MVP question 6. It will likely contain a blank cell for the row relating to employees with ‘unknown’ pension enrollment status. This is ambiguous: it would be better if this cell contained ‘unknown’ or something similar. Can you find a way to do this, perhaps using a combination of COALESCE() and CAST(), or a CASE statement?

Hints


Question 3. Find the first name, last name, email address and start date of all the employees who are members of the ‘Equality and Diversity’ committee. Order the member employees by their length of service in the company, longest first.



Question 4. [Tough!]
Use a CASE() operator to group employees who are members of committees into salary_class of 'low' (salary < 40000) or 'high' (salary >= 40000). A NULL salary should lead to 'none' in salary_class. Count the number of committee members in each salary_class.
