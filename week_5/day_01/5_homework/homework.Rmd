# Homework Info

## Learning Objectives<br>

* Practice making plots with ggplot2
* Create your own theme and use it with plots

## Background

QikBit is a start-up company producing low cost fitness trackers. Their flagship product, the KwikBit Unit1 (spot the mistake on the patent form) reproduces the functionality of the best-in-class commercial fitness trackers, but is cheap to make.  They are currently preparing to pitch to a potential investor and require a selection of charts to include in their presentation and promotional materials.

## Data

The data for this assignment is provided in the `CodeClanData` package.

* `qb_revenue_breakdown`
* `qb_monthly_sales`
* `qb_competitors`
* `qb_device_data`

Take a little time before you start to familiarise yourself with the data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(CodeClanData)

revenue_breakdown <- qb_revenue_breakdown
monthly_sales <- qb_monthly_sales
competitors <- qb_competitors
device_data <- qb_device_data

```

## Part 1

**Question 1.**  
Take the data in the dataset `qb_revenue_breakdown` and make a stacked bar chart showing the sources of revenue across the two years in the dataset.
<br>

```{r}
ggplot(revenue_breakdown) +
  aes(x = Year, y = Revenue, fill = Product) +
  geom_col()


```


**Question 2.**  
Make a line chart showing monthly sales of the "flagship product" - the 'KwikBit Unit 1' - over the last year. This data is inside `qb_monthly_sales`, but you will need to use `filter()` or `subset()` (base `R)`.
<br>

```{r}
monthly_sales %>% 
  filter(Cashflow == "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales") %>% 
  filter(Date > "2019-01-01") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = Date, y = Amount) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "2019 sales for KwikBit Unit "
  )


```


**Question 3.**  
Make a line chart showing monthly revenue and costs over the last year. This data is also in `qb_monthly_sales`.								
<br>

```{r}
monthly_sales %>% 
  filter(Cashflow != "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales") %>% 
  filter(Date > "2019-01-01") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = Date, y = Amount, colour = Cashflow) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "2019 costs"
  ) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%d-%b-%y") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```


**Question 4.**  
Show annual sales of personal fitness trackers over the last 5 years broken down by company as a ribbon plot (use `geom_area`). This data is in `qb_competitors`.
<br>

```{r}
competitors %>% 
  mutate(Revenue_thosands = Revenue/1000) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = Year, y = Revenue_thosands, fill = Company) +
  geom_area() +
  labs(
    y = "Revenue / 1000"
    
  )


```


**Question 5.**  
Now show the sales from the four competitors as a line graph. Include an extra layer that shows the data points used to make the lines.
<br>

```{r}

competitors %>% 
  mutate(Revenue_thosands = Revenue/1000) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = Year, y = Revenue_thosands, colour = Company) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    y = "Revenue / 1000"
    
  )


```


**Question 6.**  
Now the company wants to compare the number of steps that their device counts vs. their competitors. Make a line graph of the number of steps throughout time, and use faceting to compare between companies and people. The data for this is in `qb_device_data`.
<br>

```{r}

device_data %>% 
  filter(counts > 0) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x= hours, y = counts, colour = device) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(id ~ device)

```


## Part 2 

**Question 1.**  
Take the plots that you produced in part one and now polish them by:

1. Adding appropriate labels
2. Changing the scales and coordinates when appropriate.
3. Applying a unified theme, which is described below:
  * Graphs should have white backgrounds, and use colour sparingly.
  * There should be faint grid lines.
  * Font sizes should be ~12pt although titles should be slightly larger and axis labels can be slightly smaller. 
  * All plots should use colours from the following company colour scheme.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("palette.JPG")
```

Take the data in the dataset `qb_revenue_breakdown` and make a stacked bar chart showing the sources of revenue across the two years in the dataset.
<br>

```{r}
ggplot(revenue_breakdown) +
  aes(x = Year, y = Revenue, fill = Product) +
  geom_col() + 
  labs(
    title = "Source of revenue by product"
  ) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("Accessories" = "#E89FE9",
               "Smart Watches" = "#50434F",
               "Subscription Services" = "#B6A7B5",
               "Trackers" = "#F9A472")
    )

```

  filter(Date > "2019-01-01") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = Date, y = Amount) +

  ggplot()+
  aes(x = Year, y = Revenue_thosands, fill = Company) +

  labs(
    y = "Revenue / 1000",
    title = "Annual sales by year for each company")+
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("Competitor 1" = "#E89FE9",
               "Competitor 2" = "#50434F",
               "Competitor 3" = "#B6A7B5",

  geom_line() +
  labs(y = "Revenue / 1000",
       title = "Annual sales by year for each company") +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c(
      "Competitor 1" = "#E89FE9",
      "Competitor 2" = "#50434F",
      "Competitor 3" = "#B6A7B5",
      "Competitor 4" = "#F9A472"
    )
  ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  geom_point()



```

**Question 6.**  
Now the company wants to compare the number of steps that their device counts vs. their competitors. Make a line graph of the number of steps throughout time, and use faceting to compare between companies and people. The data for this is in `qb_device_data`.
<br>

```{r}

device_data <- 
mutate(device_data, decimal_hour = hours + (mins/60))


device_data %>% 
  filter(counts > 0) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x= decimal_hour, y = counts, colour = device) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(id ~ device) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Number of steps by counted by cometitors") +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c(
      "competitor1" = "#E89FE9",
      "competitor2" = "#50434F",
      "competitor3" = "#B6A7B5",
      "qikbit1" = "#F9A472"
    ))

```


# Extension

**Question 1.**  
Try out different ways of plotting these three datasets. Which graphs do you think are particularly effective at showing QikBit's success?
