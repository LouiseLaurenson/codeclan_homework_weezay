Question 1.

Load in the libraries you need, and look at the backpack data. Take note of variable names and dimensions.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(CodeClanData)



backpack <- backpack

backpack %>% 
  names()
backpack %>% 
  glimpse()
backpack %>% 
  dim()
```

The table is 100 x 9 with thr following coloumn names:
backpack_weight, body_weight ratio          
back_problems, major, year      
sex, status, units



Question 2.

What is the distribution of backpack weights that students are carrying? Choose an appropriate graph to show the distribution.

```{r}

backpack %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = backpack_weight) +
  geom_bar() + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(2,4,6,8,10,12,14)) + 
  labs(
    title = "Weight of backpacks carried"
  )

```

Summary:

This show us that most people are carrying backpakcs with the weight of 10kg 


Question 3.

Are there differences in backpack weight between sex?


```{r}

backpack %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = backpack_weight, fill = sex) +
  geom_histogram(position = "dodge", binwidth = 1) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(2,4,6,8,10,12,14)) + 
  labs(
    title = "Weight of backpacks carried by sex"
  ) + facet_wrap(~ sex)

count_data %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = backpack_weight, y = counts, colour = sex) +
  geom_line() + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(2,4,6,8,10,12,14)) + 
  labs(
    title = "Weight of backpacks carried by sex"
  ) + facet_wrap(~sex)

count_data <- backpack %>% 
  group_by(backpack_weight, sex) %>% 
  summarise(counts = n())

```
Summary:
Females most common weight was 10kg while male was 11kg 


Question 4.

What is the relationship between body weight and backpack weight?

```{r}

backpack %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = body_weight, y = backpack_weight) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point()



backpack %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = body_weight, y = backpack_weight) +
  geom_col()

```

Summary: not really a relationship 


Question 5.

Is this relationship different between men and women? Choose an appropriate plot and interpret your findings.

```{r}

backpack %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = body_weight, y = backpack_weight, fill = sex) +
  geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap(~sex)
```




Question 6.

What proportion of students report back pain?

```{r}
proportions2 <- backpack %>% 
  summarise(pp = mean(back_problems)) %>% 
  pull(pp)


```



Question 7.

Is this proportion different between men and women?

Question 8.

Now youâ€™ve investigated your data separately, create plots to describe the relationship between backpack weight, body weight, gender and reported backpain.

Try both backpack_weight and body_weight as well as the ratio.

Hint: faceting would be useful here.
